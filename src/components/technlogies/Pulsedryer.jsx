      para="One of our latest technologies, made to complement the plants is the pulse drying/instant drying unit, which can remove a required % amount of moisture contained in any homogeneous material to be processed as may be required for optimization of its further processing and can sanitize a content of drum capsules due to pressure impact, using a fully controlled process of an impulse like steam micro explosion energy release in the enclosed and sealed space, able to remove 20-90% of moisture from any material. You may think of it as industrial press working not in vertical direction only but as pressure moving in space in all directions from inside out, with condensed wastewater released by safety valve to storage tank for next stage.
  Pulse drying may be used for a variety of industries, like a food & beverage materials/ concentrates processing industry, powder or paste like materials drying, pharmaceuticals, industrial chemicals, construction materials industry, etc.
