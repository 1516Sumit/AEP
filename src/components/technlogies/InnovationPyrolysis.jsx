      para="After near 10 years of intensive RnD of various hazard waste processing, disposal, resource extraction and carbon capture or decarbonization methods, our company has developed and quite significantly improved well know pyrolysis to make it work without legacy problems, ie continuous cycle processing, without clogging pipes with heavy paraffins, collection and removal carbon black, ballast gases, cleansing of flue gaseous mix of hydrocarbon gas and water steam in a modular, closed loop system without extra consumption of water or fuel, without any discharge to biosphere, without any emissions. 

  Plus we excelled the pyrolysis to add resource recovery options like a controlled shock gas condensation to produce synthetic fuels by choice, liquification of syn.gas with 60-90% methane content for compact storage and transportation, potential use of raw pyrolysis liquid “as is” for power generation in diesel engines by M-process, and energy effective production of green Hydrogen gas in liquid metal by secondary advanced pyrolysis processing of syn.gas from waste.
  
  Each of these unique methods have been squeezed into separate compact module, which could be used as a renown Lego game block constructor to build a custom spec plant that works magic. 
  
  It can be and is widely used for various hazard waste processing without carbon emissions for extraction of an energy of choice & resource recovery as by-products or public utility services, carbon capture with verifiable carbon/ methane credit certificates done on paper or to be minted as NFT (non fungible token) on crypto- graphic blockchain network (coming soon). 
  
  
  
  The advanced pyrolysis technology without carbon emissions is an essential element of any local Circular economy, perfect for decentralized micro-grids and public utility services of the remote, resilient and sustainable communities, smart cities, and sovereign island nations in need of developing their infrastructure.
