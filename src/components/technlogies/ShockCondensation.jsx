      para="This technology allows us to convert any gaseous substance to liquid following specific condensation temperature parameters for a substance we deal with. For instance, if we deal with a water steam, we need to cool down the temperature of steam to the point of condensation, dropping temperature fast enough. The
  same applies to any other gas. Tempera ture could be dropped by several methods– by a rapid gas expansion and cooling of gas by dropping the pressure, for example, by dropping temperature fast using cryogenic technology, using membranes or other methods.
  We combine several methods to achieve a full control over the substance condition (gas, liquid, solid) change in fully controlled environment inside of our special condensation module. We have mustered shock condensation being able to drop gas temperature by several hundred (10~700*) degrees Celsius in a millisecond, as need be. With this tech we don’t even need to use a mini refinery tower module to produce synthetic fuel of choice from a wide range of available groups - solvent, gasoline, kerosine, diesel, fuel oil, etc.– not standard, but a decent quality fuel.
