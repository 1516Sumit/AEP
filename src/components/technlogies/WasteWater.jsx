      para="The Nature provides humanity with abundance of resources. Growing population, tsunami of waste, pollution, ineffective technologies and irresponsible politicians lead to situation where energy, water and food security are quickly becoming a priority for most countries and nations, not only in hot arid areas. We found a way to solve all these issues and more with our future proof, self-sufficient, effective, fully automated, clean, green and profitable, easy scalable, unique waste recycling “3-8 in 1” public utilities plant.
  Using auxiliary sustainable energy derived from waste which we have in abundance for as long as humanity exists, AEP group provides fresh water harvested from air on industrial scale. 
  
  For instance, One water module added to one pyrolysis reactor line is able to provide about 30-50MT fresh water a day 24/7, besides the other plant utilities such as waste disposal, energy of choice and industrial heat or cold supply, fresh water, carbon black powder or carbon fuel pellets, carbon credit certificates to name a few.
  
  Google search of water content in atmospheric air will give you certain data figures. Results will vary subject to proximity to a large water surface, sea, ocean, lake or river system and the efficiency of technology, cost and type of energy used for water harvesting – resource recovery. 
  
  The most freshwater harvesting from air output is available in locations within 500km wide belt from the waterways boundary. Landscape and wind patterns also can affect the water ex air output.  Nevertheless, when we produce a lot of almost free, and sustainable energy from waste or other renewable sources, like Sun, Wind or Tidal-waves with effective technologies in place (except nuclear and hydro energy), fresh water harvesting from air on industrial scale becomes a breeze.
     
  AEP group engineers have developed several fresh water supply technologies for a variety of regions and climate parameters.  
  For example, stationary or floating platforms on waterways (sea, lake) or stationary platforms onshore inland, designed like an offshore oil drilling rig, suitable for private islands near Jumeira Palm, sovereign island nations, islands in the Asia-Pacific, in the Caribbean, developing nations’ hot arid areas in Africa, Middle east, etc. Each platform is self-sufficient unit, easy to scale, built to meet the needs of a certain population and park land, gated community, garden/ orchid, golf club nearby. Green Dubai project, NEOM city & Masdar smart city projects, Malta & Madeira islands come to mind.  
  
  Our installation is very energy efficient as it uses the solar panels or energy from SMW waste and passive energy from temperature gradient – difference between the variable atmospheric air temperature and the temperature deep down below foundation piers of such “platform”. Difference >20*C is sufficient to ensure the project will work on <6-7kWh of energy per 1 m3 of water per 1 column unit, compared to 80+ KWh/m3 used for seawater desalination, and we do not count the huge capex for desalination factory construction and massive pipeline construction costs.
  This dismal energy is needed to push air through the installation equipment inside foundation piers, to condense and to pump out the fresh water. 
  
  While we admire a decisive leadership and scale of desalination plants development in GCC countries, their cost is astronomical, as they d need a separate solar or nuclear power plant to provide electricity for desalination plant energy blackhole, to achieve the economy of scale in order to cut the freshwater cost below 0.50 USD/m3. MegaWatts/hour of energy used for desalination, when in reality it is possible to build an energy passive, carbon neutral, even carbon negative installation. 
  One platform on 4-6 piers approx. 900mm in diameter with our equipment could provide up to 300m3 potable fresh water a day,
  more in day time, less at night time, as temp. gradient drops.
  
  Another method to ensure fresh water harvesting from air is to use a renewable energy from waste extracted on our recycling plant and to pump a huge amount of air through an extra shock condensation module to harvest moisture from air. This way it will not qualify for an energy passive technology, but energy consumption will be less with use of aux heat than desalination.
  
  Sure enough, fresh water supplied will have drinking quality and will pass all sanitation standards, with UV and mineralization filter for a better taste in place. This tech and installations are easy to scale. They need a low maintenance on annual basis, just like any vehicle. But the capex cost is much less than desalination plant and pipeline construction costs.
