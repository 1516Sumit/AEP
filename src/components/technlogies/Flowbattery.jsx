      para="The LEST power plant is built by stacking up the basic
  PBR modules of 7.8 kWh capacity. It's a simple, self-contained, ready-to-use, robust platform that's fully scalable. The power plant provides cost-effective and safe energy Generation and power storage with controlled release.
  
  LEST can be used as a load balancing system for public power supply systems during periods of maximum and minimum energy consumption.
  
  A PBR module is used as a source of electrical energy in the power plant. This is a patented new type of flow- through, rechargeable battery that has two differently charged active
  components/electrolytes circulating in modules/stacks.
  The electrolytes are separated by a membrane inside the PBR.
  Due to the circulation of differently charged liquids, ion exchange through this membrane creates an electric current.
  
  It's a compact all-in-one device or basic PBR unit having
  • Size: 75x80x40cm • Power: 3 kW (up to a max of 4.5 kW).
  • Capacity: 7.8 kWh with products range 48 kWh to 1,280kWh 
  
  Scalability is allowed – sequential installation of multiple PBR stacks. The device is designed for 30,000 charge/discharge cycles. At the same time, a deep, almost 100% discharge is allowed.
  
  PBR flow batteries are designed for stationary energy
  storage with a long service life in the residential, commercial
  and industrial sectors. They are easily scalable from single
  battery installation to arrays when deployed to the network.
  
  LEST's PLUG-AND-PLAY energy storage system, based on
  reliable PBR flow batteries, can move and manage large
  volumes of energy. Our PBR technology allows the user to
  independently manage, protect and monitor batteries 24/7.
  
  Unlike lithium-ion, they can be constantly discharged «to zero». PBR batteries do not degrade from deep discharge with a FAST Reloading/Refuelling capability from energy source or electrolyte
  
  PBR batteries are resistant to high temperatures and do not explode, no need for air conditioning and fire extinguishing systems. Safety for humans and the environment. PBR batteries do not contain harmful and toxic substances. The filling of PBR batteries can be Easy to dispose of and regenerage.
