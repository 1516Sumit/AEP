      para="The LEST power plant utilizes PBR modules, each with a capacity of 7.8 kWh, stacked to create a robust and scalable energy storage system. It's designed for simplicity and self-containment, offering cost-effective energy generation and controlled release capabilities."

      para1="Designed for both energy generation and storage, LEST serves as a versatile load balancing system within public power grids.It efficiently manages energy consumption during peak and off-peak periods, enhancing grid stability."

      para2="Each PBR module functions as an independent source of electrical energy within the power plant.These modules feature a patented flow-through design where two differently charged electrolytes circulate through stacks separated by membranes, generating electric current through ion exchange."

      para3="Compact and versatile, the basic PBR unit measures 75x80x40cm and delivers up to 3 kW of power(expandable to 4.5 kW), with a storage capacity ranging from 48 kWh to 1, 280 kWh."

      para4="Scalability is a key feature, allowing sequential installation of multiple PBR stacks to meet varying energy demands.The technology supports up to 30,000 charge / discharge cycles with deep discharge capability, ensuring long - term reliability."

      para5="Tailored for stationary energy storage in residential, commercial, and industrial sectors, PBR flow batteries offer exceptional longevity and scalability from single installations to large arrays integrated into power networks."

      para6="LEST employs a plug - and - play energy storage system based on reliable PBR flow batteries, facilitating efficient energy movement and management.Users can independently monitor, protect, and control batteries around the clock."

      para7="Unlike lithium - ion batteries, PBR flow batteries can be discharged fully without degradation, thanks to their rapid reloading / refueling capability from an energy source or replenished electrolyte."

      para8="Engineered for safety and sustainability, PBR batteries withstand high temperatures without risk of explosion, eliminating the need for complex cooling or fire suppression systems.They are free from harmful and toxic substances, ensuring environmental and human safety."

      para9="Advantages of LEST technology include continuous 24 / 7 operation, high energy density(600W / kg), constant power output, and long service life with eco - friendly and recyclable components."

      para10="The power plant's advanced control system (BMS) monitors voltage, current, power, and temperature in real-time, ensuring accurate operation, efficient energy management, and comprehensive safety features including overcharge/discharge protection and thermal management."
