      para="Ionization or cold plasma as method of external energy impact on a substance molecular structure found many applications in the engineering. In aero-space industry it is a substantial subject of fundamental science related to chemistry, physics, new materials. As some of AEP ENG, AEP WORKS engineers worked in avionics and aero-space industry, we’ve got some know-how, few secrets under sleeve. It gives our plant the advantage over competition.

  The technology for purifying industrial flue gases (regardless of the chemical composition and dust content) could be described,  as follows.
  
  In the first stage all Flue gases from the pyrolysis module/reactor processing input waste are being ducted to a specially designed mechanical vortex cyclone filter, where solid particles separated from gas at a micron/ submicron level up to 95.5% of the total gas particles pollution. Depending on the chemical composition of collected ash or carbon black, further use is determined for
  - ash - as a binder for the cement industry,
  - carbon - as a filler (ultraviolet protection) & black colour agent for technical plastics, dyes, paints, tyres, etc.
  
  In the second stage, flue gases cleared of dust and solid particles enter the gas processing zone using very high voltage for creation of the “ionic wind / cold plasma”. Active ions neutralize negative (harmful) chemical elements of the flue gases to neutral basic elements. 
  
  Because our pyrolysis process does not use burning oxygen O2, emission of CO2 is low, usually under 1-2%. Nevertheless, we know it is bad for biosphere, so all CO and CO2 gas must be 100% neutralised or destroyed by our filtering system. We do it in our unique ionization chamber of the gas cleansing module.
  
  Our technology does not use or contain alkalis, acids and other chemical elements, widely used in traditional wet and dry flue gas industrial cleaning systems. Electricity consumption for cleaning approx.6,000 m3 of flue gas ranges between 400-600 Watt only, depending on dust content and flue gas chemical composition.
  
  The cleaning installation module operates in automatic mode with our state of the art, round-the-clock measurement of chemical composition of flue gases before and after the cleaning system run. Redirection of cleaned once flue gas back to the closed loop system again and again allows us achieving nearly 100% cleaning of flue gas from all harmful emissions or substances. 
  The removal and collection of solid particles by-products (ash & carbon black powder) from flue gases is fully automated too. All the data from gas sensors sent to cloud for real time monitoring."
