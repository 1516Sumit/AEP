        para="For over 20 years, AEP group, originating from AEP WORKS LTD (ZAVOD AERO-ENERGO-PROM, Minsk RB), has been engaged in R&D, designing, and manufacturing waste recycling plants and equipment, heat exchangers, boiler making, HVAC systems, automation, oil refinery equipment, and biohazard waste disposal incinerators."

        para1="Ecological safety and 'kaizen' style innovation, focusing on maximum ESG impact, resource recovery, carbon capture eco-engineering, and logistics decarbonization have been priorities for the AEP founders and stakeholders for the last nine years. Despite facing challenges such as small projects, limited demand for energy in CIS markets, and pandemic restrictions, the company aimed for growth."

        para2="In 2010, AEP WORKS made practical steps for the decarbonization of logistics and transport by the RB Government contract for the Transport Ministry (Dept of Railways). They demonstrated the R&D results with 20% savings on fuel costs and a tenfold reduction in harmful emissions by improving the fuel mix. Two state academic institutions scrutinized the tests, confirming the positive results and recommending mass adoption of the engineered 'fuel-water emulsion' for freight train engines decarbonization."

        para3="By 2015, Dr. Shablov and an elite team of experienced professionals, many holding Masters and PhD degrees, shifted the business development model to align with global trends of climate action, aiming to build a carbon-neutral recycling plant and expand the business globally with their unique proprietary technologies."

        para4="In 2018, AEP WORKS sold its first Waste-to-Energy (WtE) recycling plant v1.0 to China’s Xinjiang province via a German engineering firm. Unfortunately, the Chinese closed the site, re-engineered the plant, and copied it, demonstrating the advanced state of AEPW technology in the global waste recycling market."

        para5="In 2021, AEP WORKS was awarded and named the “Centre of R&D Engineering Excellence.” In July 2022, AEP Engineering Sp.ZoO (AEP ENG) was established in Wroclaw, Poland, marking a new era for the AEP group. Academics and specialists from the Fraunhofer Institute and Ostrava University concluded that AEP’s solutions were decades ahead of the market."

        para6="AEP Engineering SpZoO, EU is the successor and manager of AEP WORKS, with over 20 years of history and close to a hundred staff and contractors. The production capacity of AEP WORKS complements the EU manufacturing and assembly facilities of AEP ENGINEERING, as the company continues its expansion with a multinational team of engineers, specialists, and workers."

        para7="For the past eight to nine years, AEP WORKS and AEP ENG have conducted extensive research and development in hazardous waste recycling, maximizing resource utilization and green energy recovery. The engineering design and R&D teams, consisting of top engineers and technicians, have expertise in various fields. After incorporating AEP ENGINEERING in Poland in June 2022, a roadshow across 15 EU countries in August 2022 resulted in five new contracts signed in Bulgaria, Montenegro, and other countries. Expansion to the European, Balkans, and ASEAN markets followed these initial achievements."

        para8="In late 2022, after presenting at the Australian Waste Expo in Melbourne, AEP TECH was incorporated in Singapore to manage sales, marketing, training, and servicing operations in the Indo-Pacific and MENA regions. Andrey Kolmogorov partnered with Dr. Vitaliy Shablov to create AEP TECH Singapore. In 2023, AEP TECH joined and completed the ASEAN’ IPPIN.ORG incubator program, becoming a member and alumni. The first AEP TECH Indonesia roadshow in October 2023 resulted in several project planning and MOU-NCNDA draft discussions with large companies."

        para9="In late 2023 to early 2024, AEP ENG achieved significant breakthroughs, including contracts with Lukoil Bulgaria refinery, a consortium for pilot plants in Poland, and a feasibility study for a project with the Bulgarian Government to replace coal-fired power stations with AEP’s LEST power batteries."

        para10="Under the leadership of Dr. Vitaliy Shablov, AEP group rapidly expanded into a holding of affiliated companies, subsidiaries, joint ventures, and public-private partnerships. They actively promote their advanced pyrolysis technologies and comprehensive solutions for waste disposal and energy production across Europe, Indo-Pacific, Africa, Oceania, ANZ, CIS, and MENA regions."
