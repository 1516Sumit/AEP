      Biomass, sewerage or natural waterways organic sediment could be processed by gasification and/or pyrolysis to energy,soil improver. Not every biomass waste could be recycled with high efficiency and high syn gasyields. Generally, plant-based oil cultures like sunflower kernel or palm oil kernel waste, coconut fibre, organic biomass/ sediment without contamination by heavy metals or radiation can be recycled for efficient resource and the energy recovery for SME needs or local Circular economy.
      Fresh, high moisture, animal farm manure (birds, pigs, cattle, horses, sheep, camels, elephants) processing by pyrolysis to 
-sterilized organic fertilizers (both - liquid and granulated) for immediate use by our pulse drying technology and/or
 - energy of choice (synthetic gas mix similar to LNG, syn fuels, electricity, green hydrogen) using extra modules, where the quality and quantity parameters of the output products/resource and energy extraction are several times better, more efficient and greener than processing by the outdated Anaerobic digestion technology of manure processing to compost / fertiliser with methane gas collection. We conducted a special study for Comparison of the Pyrolysis and Anaerobic digestion for Animal Manure processing.
 Forestry wood chips and sawdust, cellulose waste gasification processing to syn gas/ syn fuel/ electricity and carbon pellets fuel Homogenous (paste-like, granular, flaky), high moisture content Foodstuff pulse drying for up to 90% moisture removal instantly with sterilization for further processing of food ingredients to dry powder or dry mix preparations "
