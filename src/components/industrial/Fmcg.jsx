      para="*  Warehousing and logistics use a lot of various plastic packaging, generally soft plastics like polyolephins, PE, LDPE, etc plus Polystyrene separation/ infill for TV boxes, plastic pallets, HDPE plastic ties, security plastic tags, plastic seals, PVC pipes. PVC here represents a special hazard danger for processing as it contains Chlorine, we can remove safely as salts.
 
  * Plastic packaging for foods & beverages has evolved now to use a variety of plastics like PE, LDPE, HDPE, PET, PTF, PVC, etc, often with an extra layer of metallic foil. Add plastic straws and lids, jars and other plastic food containers to the mix.
   
  *  Retail shopping centres and FMCG - Fast Moving Consumer Goods industry create a lot of packaging plastics and paper waste with occasional wooden crates and steel stripes/ties in the mix.
  The problem is that most packaging waste comes all together, barely separated at the source of collection. We have solved the problem by adding a waste mix shredding module before unique pyrolysis processing. It is thermo-chemical decomposition of the plastics/ wood mix back to elements/ molecules in a controlled environment of the preheated pyrolysis reactor without oxygen (hence no O2 burning) under specific temperature & pressure parameters. Our recycling plant can handle ANY plastic waste mix without prior separation, processing plastic waste to the energy of choice (synthetic gas mix similar to LNG, syn fuels, electricity, green hydrogen) and providing extra utilities/ products like industrial heat, industrial cold by co-generation, freshwater harvesting from air on industrial scale, hot water or steam, carbon black powder or carbon fuel pellets, and carbon credit certificates, as waste processing is net carbon negative.Please, see Mixed Plastic Waste recycling presentation here."
