      para="The waste management industry has come a long way from simply collecting and dumping waste to becoming an essential part of the Circular Economy. The main challenge remains educating the general population and major clients on the importance of preliminary sorting of solid municipal waste at the source."

      para1=" Another significant issue is the contamination of household city waste with organic and food waste, making it inefficient to process mixed waste using gasification or pyrolysis. Countries like Sweden, Germany, Japan, and Lithuania, which use multiple bins for waste segregation, achieve recycling and resource recovery efficiencies of over 90%, compared to 1-9% in Australia and parts of Asia."

      para2="AEP ENG has developed technology to process both presorted and unsorted waste with any moisture or leachate content, using minimal sorting, shredding, and drying with our proprietary pulse drying technology.This prepares the waste for low-temperature pyrolysis, a process distinct from burning or incineration.Our carbon emissions negative pyrolysis system can handle waste from yellow and red lid rubbish bins in Australia, even with some contamination from food waste."

      para3="We work closely with clients using modular plants to find the most effective solutions for problematic waste.Our technology, tested on over 200 types of waste, has been praised by the Fraunhofer Institute as being '30 years ahead' and highly flexible."

      para4="Through years of R & D, we have categorized waste into several groups, each requiring specific technical parameters and reactors for advanced pyrolysis or gasification. Solid municipal waste(SMW) varies greatly in composition and is not a stable product.Even with sorting and some contamination from food waste, landfill - bound waste can be processed efficiently into refuse - derived fuel(RDF) or used for energy recovery without carbon emissions."

      para5="Our plants use thermo - chemical processes to break down waste into elements and molecules, forming synthetic flue gas and water steam.This is further processed to extract usable hydrocarbons and destroy harmful substances, producing syngas similar to LNG."

      para6="The syngas can be used directly, liquefied for storage or transportation, further refined into synthetic fuels, or converted to green hydrogen using advanced secondary pyrolysis.We offer custom-made waste processing plants tailored to client specifications and provide ongoing management, training, and servicing through joint ventures or public - private partnerships."

      para7="For local councils and waste management facilities, we offer effective, environmentally friendly solutions for various hazardous waste groups.These include agricultural waste, oil sludge, all plastic mixes, synthetic fibers, automotive waste, municipal solid waste, rubber goods, windfarm turbine blades, and medical waste.Each group requires specific handling and processing techniques to ensure safe and efficient recycling."

      para8="Food leftovers and organic waste should be processed separately through composting, worm farms, or F.O.G.O.programs due to their negative energy potential."

      para9="Our plants output multiple utility services and products, including waste disposal, electric energy generation, industrial heat and cold, and freshwater harvesting from the air."

      para10="Our process is carbon emissions negative and qualifies for carbon and methane credit certificates.Methane is captured for further use, CO and CO2 are destroyed, and dry carbon black powder or technical carbon pellets are collected as by - products.These are used for various applications, including black paint, tire infill, and fuel pellets, contributing to a circular and sustainable waste management system."
