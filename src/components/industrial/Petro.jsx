      para="As the materials used and petro-chemicals or oil refinery waste may be pretty broad and vary significantly, we put the most common types of waste, representing the most problematic waste types here* Oil/ gas drilling sites crude oil spills mixed with water,soil,sand
  collected after an accident or spills clean-up*  Fuel waste like non-standard or wasted, leaked, mixed up, fuel waste with mercaptans, impossible to process by refinery*  Oil and fuel sludge, water-flooded fuels mix with mercaptans, sulphur contaminated hydrocarbons, hard to separate or recycle.
 We have special modules to process and recycle the above petrochemical waste to remove inorganic impurities, sulphur, waste water, mercaptans for further pyrolysis processing into the energy of choice (syn gas, LSG, pyrolysis liquids, syn fuels, green hydrogen, plain electricity to supply to refinery/ public power grid needs) or to supply pyrolysis liquid to refinery for mixing it with a crude oil for secondary refining into the standard fuel products.
 
Additionally, we can help with decarbonization of transport and logistics fuel in transition to clean energy use.  We developed and built stand-alone complex for mixing and processing unmixable - fuel oil with 20% of freshwater into a very stable emulsion with great adhesion of water and hydrocarbon molecules without changing the chemical composition  of the standard road, railway, marine propulsion engines and boiler fuels used, ranging from diesel fuel D2/D4 to FO/ HFO. We remove sulphur, water, ash impurities and process the mixture to very stable emulsion, using Mixers, Separators, Chemical & Cavitation process, Ultrasound, etc. Water-Fuel emulsion changes colour to white-yellow, staying stable without separation in fuel storage 12+ months.  But the best results are when used inside standard engines/ boilers. Our emulsion burns x10 times better than standard fuel and creates x100 times less harmful carbon emission compared to standard fuels, improving the sustainability, reducing emissions, engines wear & tear, negative impact on our environment. Just imagine the savings in the fuel costs and positive impact on the business bottom line and on our biosphere ! We build de-sulphur/ de-carb processing units with capacity of 1M and 2M m3 pa, easy to scale up by adding extra units, if needed.
