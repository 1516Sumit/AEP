    para="Due to the large number of old, end-of-life cycle tires going to landfills every year, tire and rubber goods waste is a significant problem for every country or big city. Recycling tires is difficult due to the durable materials used for tire manufacturing. Rubber goods like tires, conveyor belts, and gum boots do not decay, decompose, or rust by themselves in landfills for hundreds of years. At the same time, tires and rubber are made of hydrocarbons that can be used for resource recovery and energy extraction. Mining and other industries that use conveyor belts also need a recycling solution."

para1="AEP ENG has found a way to effectively recycle all rubber goods, conveyor belts, and old end-of-life cycle tires through a thermochemical pyrolysis process. Our rubber goods and tire recycling plant v3.0 has advanced significantly compared to the v1.0 we sold to China in 2018. The new plant has no exhaust pipe stack and can prepare, shred, and recycle tires of almost any size and type, including those with nylon or steel cords."

para2="Our plant can process approximately 30 metric tons of shredded tires or rubber products per unit per day, operating 24/7 in a continuous, fully automated process with only 3-4 workers needed per shift. The plant's output includes 3-4 MWh of electricity and 2-3 MWh of industrial heat or cold, along with other optional features like freshwater from air, approximately 3 metric tons per day of carbon black powder, and approximately 1 metric ton per day of steel cord for metal smelters, depending on the volume of steel cord tires."

para3="According to our chemical lab information, one standard vehicle tire weighs 6.5 kg, from which we can obtain 3.2 liters of synthetic fuel. Our plant can produce up to 40% of synthetic fuels by input waste weight, which translates to approximately 12+ metric tons of usable fuel from 30 metric tons of rubber waste per day, operating 24/7 with exhaust and extra fuel as our plant works off self-generated energy from waste."

para4="As an option, we can use a different module to produce pyrolysis liquid and semi-finished synthetic fuels, such as synthetic gasoline, kerosene, diesel fuel, and fuel oil for boilers, instead of electricity."

para5="Despite having no sulfur, ash, water, and high octane/cetane numbers with high calorific capacity, our synthetic fuels are not standard and could not be certified as standard fuels made from crude oil."

para6=" However, they have a quality very similar to standard fuels and could be used safely for mixing with standard fuels or alone for most engines. We use it for power generation instead and for our own fleet. This synthetic fuel could also be sold to the oil refinery as a semi-finished product."

para7="We found that electricity generation from old tires makes more sense and does not require extra equipment for the refinery module or additional hassles for synthetic fuel certification. Electricity is in high demand and has standard parameters, which can be accumulated in an optional LEST PBRO module for peak/off-peak power supply for a local remote community or local industrial hub."

para8="This solution can become an essential part of the circular economy of a smart city, local council, or resilient remote sustainable community with a great environmental, social, and governance (ESG) impact. Our approach not only addresses the tire and rubber waste problem but also contributes to sustainable energy production and resource recovery."

para9="By implementing our advanced recycling technology, communities and industries can significantly reduce their environmental footprint. The AEP ENG recycling plant v3.0 represents a breakthrough in waste management, offering practical and efficient solutions for problematic waste streams."

para10="In summary, AEP ENG's tire and rubber goods recycling plant provides an innovative, sustainable, and highly efficient way to handle end-of-life rubber products, transforming waste into valuable energy and resources, and contributing to a cleaner, more sustainable future."
