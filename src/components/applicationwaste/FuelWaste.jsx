      para="This waste type requires more sophisticated approach with preliminary waste processing to recover usable resource and 
  at stage 1 – to remove water, then remove a sulphur, ash and mercaptans, using specialised equipment and thermochemical tech processes to produce a crude oil like or semi finished fuel oil like substance, all refineries can use for mixing with crude  and for further processing without problem, thus significantly boosting refinery efficiency and profitability. 
  Additional and completely different form recycling plant set of equipment is necessary for this type of waste preparation and processing for valuable resource recovery before the stage 2 – actual waste recycling to energy of choice, if needed.
  
  The plant configuration depends on the task at hand. If the energy of choice such as syn.gas or certain group of bio-fuel or electricity is required as the most desirable and feasible outcome, then we add few other functional modules and power generation module to achieve that. 
  
  Our Pulsar-EL plant is the best matching equipment for this task. Large quantities of waste fuel or contaminated oil sludge is produced and accumulated over time on all refineries. New fuel products or electricity may be used by SME handling this kind of refuse to boost their bottom line by using own energy or to develop local Circular economy for maximum ESG and to meet several UN SDGs, whichever is a priority for SME, NPO/NGO, or local community with such waste issue.
