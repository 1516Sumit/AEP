      para="MSW quantity is growing with population consumption to tsunami of waste pollution, measured in BLNs of MT pa on a global scale.
  The challenges for waste management here are the collection, transportation, storage, sorting, upcycling or recycling, plus education of the general population to do their household garbage pre-sorting prior to the waste collection in order to increase the subsequent waste recycling efficiency and to achieve a maximum value, resource and energy recovery from waste ever possible.  
  
  The weather and organics/food contamination of MSW also affect the waste quality as natural precipitation creates a leachate – a stinky slurry or waste juice, making the waste recycling even harder and inefficient.
  
  Pre-Sorting of waste and storage away from the nature elements allow waste management companies achieving maximum value extraction, max resource recovery from waste with top efficiency
  95-97% by volume in Sweden, Germany, Lithuania, Japan. 
  In the South-East Asia, in Australia and Oceania, Latin America waste recycling and resource recovery efficiency stays between
  0 and 9% at best, with majority of MSW going to the landfills.
  
  Recent advancement in automation, optical shape and colors recognition combined with the AI controlled robotics and automation are used for MSW sorting now and let some waste management companies lift their game and achieve maximum value extraction and resource recovery from waste, leaving 3-5% as MSW tails destined for landfills. 
  
  Unsorted MSW processing, resource recovery and recycling is a very different cattle of fish. Japanese and British companies promote their “harmless” IBA (incineration bottom ash) plants
  which are in fact a cluster of huge incineration ovens, where SMW is fed in as is, unsorted, brought in by dump trucks, and is burned down with extra help from turbo charged fuel or gas burners, while huge steel mesh conveyor belts move this burning rubbish up and up inside these huge ovens mounted on several levels in a serpent or zigzag shape to maximize the incineration surface and efficiency. 
  
  Naturally, burned to ash waste drops through the steel mesh conveyor down to the bottom of these ovens, creating piles of bottom ash full of furans, dioxins and heavy metals harmful to humans and environment. Despite all shortfalls some local councils and waste management companies embraced the simplicity of this IBA method, especially when producer says they built another comprehensive top notch exhaust filtering system above and it is completely s
  Swiss authorities did a research afe now, which is a lie. 
  of soil and water samples analysis taken in 20km radius from all coal fired power stations and the waste fired IBA power stations to demonstrate that both types produce pollution source with high concentrations of dioxins, furanes, heavy metals on all sites. Bottom ash is used as cement binder or infill agent for production of concrete blocks & tiles, is a ticking time bomb left for our children to live through consenquences and lies of IBA plant promoters and spruikers.                                                                    
  
  The best practices show that those too could be shredded into RDF – refuse derived fuel and utilised by scrap smelters, coal fired electric power stations, etc. While it is by itself a significant move to 100% waste recycling, it is still very harmful for bio-sphere, as even the most advanced"
