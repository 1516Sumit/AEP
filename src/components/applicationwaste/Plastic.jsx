    para="Humans produce over 20 BLN mt of waste pa, plastic polymers share is 15-25%. Re-use, Re-fill, 
Re-purpose efforts do not work for Waste Plastics Pollution , wrecking oceans, lands, tourism."
    para1="Biosphere pollution/ Carbon emissions have reached critical point. Climate action is overdue. 
Talking awareness doesn’t solve the problems. Very few green, efficient solutions available."
    para2="UN ESG & Govt policies led to the fossil fuels production halt, causing Energy Crisis worldwide. 
Renewable energy technologies like Solar/ Wind are inadequate, not reliable. Hydro-/ Nuclear are 
often complex, hard, slow to build. All customers are looking for new effective solutions.
"
para3="After 8 years of RnD our team HIT ALL THREE PROBLEMS above WITH ONE SOLUTION -
WtE / EfW pyrolysis plant for the carbon emissions negative plastic waste disposal & recycling as decentralised, versatile 6-in-1 Utilities plant for the waste, energy, water services provision."

para4="An eco-friendly, efficient, decentralised utilities mini-plant 
to convert all plastics waste into renewable gas (CH4, H2), 
energy (electricity, heat/cold) and to harvest a fresh water 
from air through the advanced, carbon negative recycling, 
processing, filtration mechanisms to meet 11 UN SDGs for 
a maximum Environment, Social, Governance impact."

para5="Eco-positive: No exhaust pipestack, no environmental damage, no discharge, with Net negative 
carbon footprint able to earn the Carbon credits. Low maintenance (once a year).  Independence & Scalability: decentralised Utilities plant combining Energy from Waste*& 
Fresh Water production from Air*, fast deployable, modular, self-sufficient, easily scalable.  Versatile Revenue: Multiple commercial opportunities through diverse by-products in demand.  Advanced Automation: Fully computerized, remotely controlled system, engaging a real time 
Cloud technology for a seamless and safe, continuous cycle operations 24/7.  Safety First: Explosion-proof design with the integrated Fire extinguishing systems.  Economical Setup: Modular design, No major construction costs, just a sturdy base required.  Green Innovation: Cutting-edge conversion of waste* to green hydrogen through an energyefficient liquid metal system (with lower energy consumption than electrolysis system)."

para6="The Solution Maturity / Traction
In 2018 AEP sold first WtE mini plant v1.0 to China, Xinjang for old tyres recycling. 2020-2021 let us do a 
lot of RnD, with new versions of the Lego style modular Utility plant developed, designed and lab stand/ 
prototype built. Modern Oil Chemistry laboratory established.
In 2022 built one mini plant v2.0 for oil sludge recycling into energy for the oil exploration company with 
delivery to Lybia, to service the oil rig and workers camp. In Q3/2022 set up new up company AEP 
Engineering Zp OO in Wroclaw, Poland. In Q4/2023 set up AEP Technologies in Singapore for expansion to 
the Indo-Pacific and ASEAN markets."

para7="In Q4/2022-Q1/2023 with conferences at Fraunhofer Institute in Germany and Ostrava Uni in Czech Rep., 
and after the 15 EU countries road show we signed new contracts in Bulgaria : 
= Stage one – build large EU poultry farm manure blast drying plant, Stage two- build plant for poultry 
manure processing into electricity & heat, liquid fertiliser for immediate use, fresh water. 
= Plant for German originated waste plastics mix processing to electricity for EU power grid. 
= Bulgaria Oil Refinery waste gasoline/ oil sludge waste processing into electricity for EU grid.
In Q2/ 2023 new contract with Montenegro state power company for MSW to electricity, contract in RB 
for waste engine oil/ oil filters processing to energy. Negotiations underway in Indonesia, Fiji"
