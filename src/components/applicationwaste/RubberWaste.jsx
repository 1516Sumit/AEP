  Works – AEP ENG predecessor has sold its first tyre recycling plant Pulsar with block burners and exhaust pipe stack v1.0 to Xinjiang China in 2018 and later improved its design significantly in 2020 as carbon emissions negative Pulsar EL v3.0 making it work without an exhaust pipe stack at all. 
  
  In 2021 AEP ENG has re-designed original Pulsar recycling plant, making it a modular, flexible, multi-functional and more efficient, LEGO game like scalable public utilities complex, able to do waste disposal, waste to energy of choice transformation, industrial heat or cold supply, and harvesting a fresh water from air on industrial scale, plus issuing carbon / methane credit certificates upon plant completion & certification by third party. 
  
  We made it an ultimate solution and a Swiss knife of public utility services provision, with decentralised power micro-grids for remote, sustainable, resilient communities, smart cities, cluster developments, and sovereign island nations, developing countries with insufficient public utilities infrastructure, located in hot arid areas.  
  
  We use Pulsar EL modular recycling plant to meet the clients’ ESG strategy, UN SDG aspirations fast, here and now, not by 2050.
